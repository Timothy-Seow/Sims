/**
 * A utility factory class for creating and initializing Sims and their environments.
 * <p>
 * This class provides static methods to bootstrap the game world with default Sims,
 * homes, skills, and needs. It ensures that each Sim is consistently initialized
 * with a home, career, skill set, and needs, making it easier to start a new game
 * or generate test scenarios.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #defaultGame()} – Creates a predefined list of Sims with careers, homes, skills, and needs.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #defaultHome(String)} – Builds a personalized home with default locations, activities, and upgrades.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #createSim(String, int, int, Home, Career)} – Constructs a fully initialized Sim with the given attributes.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #createSkills()} – Generates a baseline skill map for Sims, covering all primary need categories.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #createNeeds()} – Generates a baseline needs map for Sims, with decay rates for each need type.</li>
 * </ul>

 *
 * <p>
 * By centralizing Sim creation logic, this class promotes consistency and reduces
 * duplication across the game engine. It acts as the entry point for setting up
 * new Sims and their environments.
